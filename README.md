# Cucumber-Java Belly

Simple Cucumber-JVM example based on the [Cucumber Skeleton](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-java-skeleton.git).


## Run tests using Maven

From command line:

    mvn test

This runs Cucumber features using Cucumber's JUnit runner. The `@RunWith(Cucumber.class)` annotation on the `RunCukesTest`
class tells JUnit to kick off Cucumber.
